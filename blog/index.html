		<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines a standardized recipe as one that “has been tried, adapted, and retried several times for use by a given foodservice operation and has been found to produce the same good results and yield every time when the exact procedures are used with the same type of equipment and the same quantity and quality of ingredients” in the manual, A Tool Kit for Healthy School Meals: Recipes and Training Materials (p. 37). The terms “quantity recipes” and “standardized recipes” often are confused with each other. Many recipes are written to produce large quantities of food. Any recipe that produces 25 servings or more is termed a quantity recipe. Quantity recipes are not standardized, however, until they have been adapted to an individual school foodservice operation</p>
